Today we are releasing Deno 1.7.0. This release contains many new features, some
stabilizations, a some great improvements to existing APIs and tooling.

- [**Support of data URL imports**](#):
- [**DNS querying via `Deno.resolveDns`**](#):
- [**Improvements to `deno compile`**](#):

If you already have Deno installed you can upgrade to 1.7 by running
`deno upgrade`. If you are installing Deno for the first time, you can use one
of the methods listed below:

```shell
# Using Shell (macOS and Linux):
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows):
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Using Homebrew (macOS):
brew install deno

# Using Scoop (Windows):
scoop install deno

# Using Chocolatey (Windows):
choco install deno
```

## Improvements to `deno compile`

In the last release we added the ability to compile applications written for
Deno into standalone, self contained executables. When we announced this in the
1.6 blog post, we had a list of pain points and features we wanted to address.
This release addresses three of these.

We are happy to announce that in 1.7 `deno compile` can now cross compile from
any in stable supported architecture (Windows x86, macOS x86, and Linux x86) to
any other in stable supported architecture. This means you can now create
binaries for Windows and macOS from a single Linux CI machine.

In addition we are happy to announce that `deno compile` can now generate
binaries that are 40-60% smaller than in 1.6.x. To try out this experimental
feature, use the flag `--lite` when compiling your application. This set
`deno compile` to use a slimmed down runtime-only Deno binary instead of the
full Deno binary that is used now.

**TODO: need gif for lite binary cross compile. Waiting on cross compile to land
in canary.**

Finally, `deno compile` can now create binaries that have built in CA
certificates, custom V8 flags, locked down Deno permissions, and pre-populated
command line arguments. This should make `deno compile` useful to more people.

Here is an example where we create a file_server executable from the
std/http/file_server module that listens on port 8080 (instead of default 4507),
and has CORS enabled. The permissions that the running code has is also locked
down (can only read from current working directory, and can only listen on port
8080).

## Add support for `globalThis.location` and relative fetch

An unfortunate effect of Deno not having a "document" to run it's JavaScript in
(a HTML page), is that Deno has never had a good way to determine the `origin`
of a script. This is important for APIs like `window.localstorage` that are
specific to a certain file type. The localstorage API is something that requires
this, that we want to add soon.

This is also very useful for isomorphic code (code that runs on client and
server), for example during server side rendering of React components, because
they can now both make use of `globalThis.location` and relative `fetch`.

In this release we are addressing this with the addition of the `--location`
flag that lets you set "document" location for scripts. This location can be any
`http` or `https` URL (it does not need to exist). If this flag is unset,
`window.location` will still be present, but will throw on access. The same goes
for relative URLs in `fetch` and `new Worker`. They will be relative to the
location if it is set, otherwise they will throw. In workers the location will
always be set to the entrypoint script of the Worker.

```shell
$ cat example.ts
console.log(globalThis.location.href);

const res = await fetch("/std/version.ts");
console.log(res.status, res.url);
console.log(await res.text());
$ deno run --location="https://deno.land" --allow-net example.ts
https://deno.land/
200 https://deno.land/std@0.83.0/version.ts
// Copyright 2018-2020 the Deno authors. All rights reserved. MIT license.
/** Version of the Deno standard modules
 *
 * Deno std is versioned differently than Deno cli because it is still unstable;
 * the cli's API is stable. In the future when std becomes stable, likely we
 * will match versions with cli as we have in the past.
 */
export const VERSION = "0.83.0";

```

We are aware that some modules use `window.location` to determine if they are
running in a browser or not. This is bad practice. Use
`typeof Deno !== "undefined"` to determine if you are running in Deno, and use
`typeof document !== "undefined"` to determine if the DOM is available or not.

## Support for `fetch` request body streaming

Next to our support for streaming response bodies in `fetch`, we now also
support streaming request bodies. This can be used to upload a large file to a
webserver, without first having to buffer it in memory. This can be done by
passing a `ReadableStream` to the `body` field in the `fetch` options.

```ts
import { readableStreamFromAsyncIterator } from "https://deno.land/std@0.84.0/io/streams.ts";

// Open the file we want to upload to the server.
const file = await Deno.open("./large_file_on_disk.txt");

// Construct a `ReadableStream` from the `Deno.Reader` returned by `Deno.open`.
const body = readableStreamFromAsyncIterator(Deno.iter(file));

// Send the body to the server.
const res = await fetch("https://myfileserver.com/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body,
});
```

Currently the only runtimes supporting fetch upload streaming are Chromium and
Deno. Both implementations have a limitation where you can not start recieving
the response body until the request body has been fully sent. This is not a
limitation in the Fetch specification, rather in the implementations, and will
be addressed in the future. For some more examples and usecases for fetch upload
streaming take a look at [Jake Archibald's](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)
post on the matter: https://web.dev/fetch-upload-streaming/.

## Changes to Deno APIs

We are happy to stabilize `Deno.shutdown` in this release. This function lets
you shut down a socket cleanly (so flushing all data before closing). This can
be called instead of `Deno.close` for supported sockets. Unlike the unstable
version of this API, no socket mode has to be specified when shutting down, as
you only can only really shut down the write end of a socket.

In this release the signature of the option bag for the unstable
`Deno.createHttpClient` API has changed. This API can be used to customize how a
fetch is executed. Instead of being able to specify `caFile` (the path to a file
containing a custom CA certificate), you now specify `caData`. This means you
can now use in memory certificates for `Deno.createHttpClient`.

```diff
- const client = Deno.createHttpClient({ caFile: "./my_ca.pem" });
- const res = await fetch("https://my.kubernetes:4443", { client })
+ const client = Deno.createHttpClient({ caData: Deno.readFileSync("./my_ca.pem") });
+ const res = await fetch("https://my.kubernetes:4443", { client })
```

The unstable `Deno.permission` APIs for the `net` permission have also changed
slightly. Instead of taking / returning a `url` parameter, we now use `host`, to
match what the `--allow-net` flag supports.

```diff
- await Deno.permissions.query({ name: "net", url: "localhost:4000" });
+ await Deno.permissions.query({ name: "net", host: "localhost:4000" });
```
