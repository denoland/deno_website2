Today we are releasing Deno 1.6.0. This release contains a few new features,
many feature stabilizations, and a ton of bug fixes. Here are some highlights:

- [**Build self contained binaries**](#): TODO
- [**TypeScript 4.1**](#): TODO
- [**Built-in Deno Language Server**](#): TODO

If you already have Deno installed you can upgrade to 1.6 by running
`deno upgrade`. If you are installing Deno for the first time, you can use one
of the methods listed below:

```shell
# Using Shell (macOS and Linux):
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows):
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Using Homebrew (macOS):
brew install deno

# Using Scoop (Windows):
scoop install deno

# Using Chocolatey (Windows):
choco install deno
```

# New features and changes

## `deno compile`: creating self-contained binaries

Limitations:

- no workers
- no dynamic import
- always allow all / no flag support

VFS:

- import asserts
- asset references proposal

Next iterations:

- permissions, other flags
- cross compile
- lite binaries (20mb)

## Built-in Deno Language Server

<img src="/posts/v1.6/lsp.gif">

Starting with Deno 1.6 the binary will ship with self-contained
implementation of language server that implemens [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)

In parallel, we're working on the new version of VSCode extension
that uses the LSP. This version of extension is still considered
a "canary", but don't hesitate to try it out and give us feedback!

[VSCode Deno Canary](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno-canary) _(keep in mind that old version of extension should be disabled, otherwise diagnostics might be duplicated)_

Providing a self-contained LSP in the Deno binary will make it easier
to provide integration with Deno for other code editors. We'll be more than
happy to coordinate with the community during the integration.

Currently supported features:

- Go to definition
- Go to references
- Hints on hover
- `deno fmt` integration
- `deno lint` integration

The LSP is still in the early stages of development, to track the progress
follow [issue #8643](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/8643).

## Migration to stricter type checks complete

Mention prev blog post. Now not configurable.

Reason we did this. Link to benchmark.

## TypeScript 4.1

Deno 1.6 ships with the latest version of TypeScript.

For more information on new features in Typescript 4.1 visit official introductory blog post: 
[Announcing TypeScript 4.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/)

## Canary channel

Warning that this should only be used by advanced users.

Upgrade using `deno upgrade --canary`. You must be on 1.6 or later. Mention
downgrading can corrupt deno dir.

`deno --version` output

Can be downloaded from dl.deno.land.

## Changed to `std/bytes`

As a part of the efforts of [Standard Library Working Group](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/8405);
`std/bytes` module had seen major overhaul. 

Most of the APIs were renamed to better align with the APIs available on `Array`:

- `copyBytes` -> `copy`
- `equal` -> `equals`
- `findIndex` -> `indexOf`
- `findLastIndex` -> `lastIndexOf`
- `hasPrefix` -> `startsWith`
- `hasSuffix` -> `endsWith`
