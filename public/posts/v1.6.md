Today we are releasing Deno 1.6.0. This release contains a few new features,
many feature stabilizations, and a ton of bug fixes. Here are some highlights:

- [**Build self contained binaries**](#): TODO
- [**TypeScript 4.1**](#): TODO
- [**Built-in Deno Language Server**](#): TODO

If you already have Deno installed you can upgrade to 1.6 by running
`deno upgrade`. If you are installing Deno for the first time, you can use one
of the methods listed below:

```shell
# Using Shell (macOS and Linux):
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows):
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Using Homebrew (macOS):
brew install deno

# Using Scoop (Windows):
scoop install deno

# Using Chocolatey (Windows):
choco install deno
```

# New features and changes

## `deno compile`: creating self-contained binaries

- no dynamic import
- always allow all / no flag support

VFS:

- import asserts
- asset references proposal

Next iterations:

- permissions, other flags
- cross compile

## Built-in Deno Language Server

<img src="/posts/v1.6/lsp.gif">

Deno 1.6 ships with a new `deno lsp` subcommand that starts
a language server that implements [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

[VSCode Deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) is an official VSCode extension
that implements a lot of functionality by duplicating fundamental behaviours of Deno; a stark example is module resolution
logic that requires module specifiers with extensions or support for import maps. Keeping extension logic in sync with
Deno logic posed a significant challenge in itself, while providing high quality IDE experience in an editor other than VSCode
would require to duplicate the efforts all over. Providing a self-contained LSP implementation in Deno makes it easier
to provide a high-quality and unified editing experience for all code editors that understand LSP.

The LSP is in the early stages of the development, but it already supports some crucial features:

- Go to definition
- Go to references
- Hints on hover
- `deno fmt` integration
- `deno lint` integration

To track the progress of the development follow [issue #8643](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/8643).

[VSCode Deno Canary](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno-canary) is a new version
of VSCode extension that uses `deno lsp`. It is also in the early stages of the development and is not 
yet as featureful as `VSCode Deno`.

_If you decide to give it a try make sure to disable the old version of the extension, otherwise diagnostics might be duplicated._

## Migration to stricter type checks complete

Mention prev blog post. Now not configurable.

Reason we did this. Link to benchmark.

## TypeScript 4.1

Deno 1.6 ships with the latest version of TypeScript.

For more information on new features in Typescript 4.1 visit official introductory blog post: 
[Announcing TypeScript 4.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/)

## Canary channel

Warning that this should only be used by advanced users.

Upgrade using `deno upgrade --canary`. You must be on 1.6 or later. Mention
downgrading can corrupt deno dir.

`deno --version` output

Can be downloaded from dl.deno.land.

## Changed to `std/bytes`

As a part of the efforts of [Standard Library Working Group](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/8405);
`std/bytes` module had seen major overhaul. 

Most of the APIs were renamed to better align with the APIs available on `Array`:

- `copyBytes` -> `copy`
- `equal` -> `equals`
- `findIndex` -> `indexOf`
- `findLastIndex` -> `lastIndexOf`
- `hasPrefix` -> `startsWith`
- `hasSuffix` -> `endsWith`
